# Random-quote-generator
As part of the JSBeginners 100 days of coding here is a random quote generator. 
This is the first of many projects I will be uploading here from this page focusing on Javascript
as I work to build my portfolio. 

For this project the css and html were only slightly altered from the provided version. 

The Javascript was created for the actual generation of quotes. 
Several quotes are located inside an array and one is called at random every time the generate quote button is clicked.
